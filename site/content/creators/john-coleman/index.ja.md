John Coleman hosts the Evolved podcast, focusing on product and design leadership, as well as executive management. He is a co-founder of Evolved.Institute and Orderly Disruption.

He is a consultant and trainer on several approaches that address ambidexterity, adaptiveness, humane effectiveness, and timeliness. He specializes in executive content, product management, scaling, descaling, measurement, and coherence between team approach and management processes.

His typical consulting footprint spans from the West Coast of the USA to Eastern Europe, with a primary focus on the USA. His training footprint is global. His globally recognized training badges do not restrict John’s work. He is well-researched and pragmatic.

He co-created Kanplexity, an approach based on Kanban and Cynefin, the complexity sense-making framework; it has only two roles: team/crew and guide.

He also created MORE executive success, an approach for executives and company board members to improve adaptiveness to market needs.
